NanoGPT from Andrej Karpathy's Video tutorial

Decided to learn from the entire playlist ....

Some high level learnings

1. Pytorch Documentation - the detail and depth of understanding of this library
2. Lego blocks type of building
3. Understanding the calculus - (n - 1) instead of n !!!
4. Step by Step - Explanation
5. Understanding of the library in depth and even questioning it (Repeated yes ....)
6. Dimensions, dimensions and broadcasting !!!
7. Subtle bugs - Generally because of broadcasting and not understanding the dimensions of the vectors
8. As he says - "lot of gymnastics around these multi-dimensional arrays, ton of trying to make these shapes work, layers shape"
9. He prototypes the layers in a jupyter notebook to check if it works and then transfers it to a working model
10. Dilated causal convoluted layers !!! A mouthful !!!
